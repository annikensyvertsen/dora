          <p>Dora the Exploration Center will allow for people to visit and be a part of nature no matter the season. By creating a tropical jungle within the city with warm temperatures, light and the feel of nature, people struggling with seasonal affective disorder are given a place to escape during the colder, darker months. The hope for the project is to encourage people to seek out nature and to lower the threshold for leaving their home and experiencing nature in new ways. If successful, Dora the Exploration Center have the possibility to contribute to the mental health of the citizens of Trondheim.
